Check that the "src" folder is marked as a source folder: Right-click on the "src" folder
in your project and select "Mark Directory as" > "Sources Root". This should mark the "src"
folder as a source folder for your project, which may help IntelliJ IDEA recognize that Java classes should be created there.
Check that the Java plugin is installed and enabled: Go to "File" > "Settings" (on Windows) or
"IntelliJ IDEA" > "Preferences" (on macOS) to open the Settings dialog box. In the left-hand panel,
navigate to "Plugins" and make sure that the Java plugin is installed and enabled. If it's not installed,
click the "Install" button next to it and then restart IntelliJ IDEA.
Check that you are creating the Java class in the right place: Right-click on the "src" folder in your project
and select "New" > "Java Class". Make sure that you are not creating the class inside a subdirectory of "src",
as the Java Class option may not be available in subdirectories.
